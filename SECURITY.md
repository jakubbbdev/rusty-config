## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within RustyConfig, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

### What to include in your report

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 1 week
- **Fix release**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### Security best practices

When using RustyConfig:

1. **Validate all configuration data** before use
2. **Use secure file permissions** for configuration files
3. **Avoid storing sensitive data** in plain text configuration files
4. **Regularly update dependencies** to get security patches
5. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration when possible

### Known security considerations

- Configuration files are loaded from the filesystem without encryption
- Hot-reload functionality watches file system events
- Validation is performed at runtime, not compile time
- No built-in encryption for configuration data

### Future security enhancements

- [ ] Configuration encryption support
- [ ] Secure configuration templates
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Audit logging for configuration changes
